# Monitoring in Environment

This project has been created to spin up a simple monitoring training environment within either OpenShift or Kubernetes for using the following tools;

* Grafana
* Prometheus
* ITRS
  - Note for ITRS you'll need to uncomment the code in docker-compose.yml and also add you .lic license file to the **containers/itrs/files/ITRS** folder.
* ELK
* Others may be added

The applications that will be monitored are;

* PetClinic
* Moodle
* MySQL
  - Monitored through a separate container running mysqld_node_exporter

When using the docker-compose system you can point your web browser at the following ports;
* PetClinic
  - http://localhost:1080
* Moodle
  - http://localhost:1180
  - http://localhost:8443
* Prometheus
  - Metrics
    - http://localhost:9090/metrics
  - Web expression browser
    - http://localhost:9090/graph
* Grafana
  - http://localhost:3000

## Docker

To have your Docker daemon monitored by Prometheus you will need to configure your Docker system's /etc/docker/daemon.json with the following;

```
{
  "metrics-addr": "127.0.0.1:9323",
  "experimental": true
}
```

In your prometheus.yaml configuration you will need to add the following scraper;
```
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'docker'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['127.0.0.1:9323']
```

Then start a single service;
```
docker service create --replicas 1 --name my-prometheus \
    --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/prometheus.yml,destination=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    --publish published=9090,target=9090,protocol=tcp \
    prom/prometheus
```

You can view the target at http://localhost:9090/targets/

See https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/prometheus/ and https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-metrics for further details.


## Process monitoring of /proc

For when we don't have access to the code, use the process-exporter from https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter.  With binary releases at https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter/releases/tag/v0.7.5.

* https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter/releases/download/v0.7.5/process-exporter-0.7.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
* https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter/releases/download/v0.7.5/process-exporter_0.7.5_linux_amd64.deb
* https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter/releases/download/v0.7.5/process-exporter_0.7.5_linux_amd64.rpm

Install on the docker system you wish to monitor.

Usage;
```
process-exporter [options] -config.path filename.yml
```

Configuration file
```
process_names:
  - process_name1
  - process_name2
  - name: "{{.Comm}}"
    cmdline:
    - '.+'
```
